# VoltaML-Assignment

Problem Statement:

Who's a good dog? Who likes ear scratches? Well, it seems those fancy deep neural networks don't have all the answers. However, maybe they can answer that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what kind of good pup is that? I tried to provide a solution on how well people can differentiate your Norfolk Terriers from your Norwich Terriers? With 120 breeds of dogs and a limited number training images per class.

Objective:

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine or deep learning-based model to classify different types of dog breeds accurately.  Your task is to classify each dog image in the given test dataset of 10,400  images into one of the 120 dog breeds.

About the dataset:

The dataset is provided with a training set and a test set of images of dogs. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs. The goal of the competition is to create a classifier capable of determining a dog's breed from a photo. The dataset provide a training dataset of 10,200  labeled images of dog breeds. Our task is to develop an accurate breed classification model using the training dataset and then classify each sample in the test dataset of 10,400 dog images into one of the 120  dog breeds.

Files:

train.csv - The training set
image_id - Unique image identifier corresponds to image file names (.jpg) found in the train_images directory. 

sample_submission.csv - Sample submission file.

train_images - This directory contains 10,200 training images. Filename corresponds to the image_id column of train.csv.

test_images - This directory contains 10,400 test set images.
